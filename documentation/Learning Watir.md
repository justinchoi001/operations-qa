##Getting Started
This article assumes that you've read through the "What is Watir" and "Installation and Setup" guides and that you are comfortable writing in Ruby. This guide will not to teach you how to program in Ruby, but will provide a basic tutorial of popular commands in Watir.

##Quick Tip
Don't forget to use your best friend in Ruby: IRB. IRB stands for _interactive Ruby_ and it's a great tool to interactively execute Ruby commands/expressions from your terminal. To start it up, simply open a terminal or command prompt window and type:
``` html
irb
```
You can use IRB to test commands that you'll need for your scripts. For example, when you're trying to find a web element on a page, you can try doing so in IRB first, and when you've successfully grabbed the web element, you can copy the correct command you used to your test script for permanent usage. This way, you don't need to execute your whole script every time to see if something works or fails.
