"Watir, _pronounced water_, is an open-source (BSD) family of Ruby libraries for automating web browsers. It allows you to write tests that are easy to read and maintain. It is simple and flexible."

"**Watir** stands for **W**eb **A**pplication **T**esting **i**n **R**uby..."

<h3>What Are We Using?</h3>
Watir actually has a whole host of tools that do a lot of different things. For our current purposes in Operations: QA, we'll be using the **watir-webdriver** for testing.  

<h3>What Is Watir-Webdriver?</h3>
Watir-webdriver uses a modernized version of the Watir API and is a wrapper around the Selenium 2.0 API (selenium-webdriver), and is written in Ruby. What does any of this mean? It means that we'll be using Ruby to write our tests, and it means that we can essentially think of ourselves as using Selenium 2.0 with some fancy Watir API calls to boost our efficiency and effectiveness. Watir-webdriver is also built from the HTML specification, so that means we should always be compatible with the current W3C specifications.

<h3>But Why Watir?</h3>
A few of our Operations: QA team members actually did some extensive research to find the best tool to help us automate tests for our Support Systems (e.g. LESA, Customer Portal, Patcher). All of our UAT tests were done manually, so it was important for us to find a robust software tool that could be used for all of our Support Systems (_eventually_). We strongly considered using POSHI, which is our in-house framework that Liferay QA uses, but it was too heavy, had too many dependencies, and was not built to test in multiple browsers. We wanted to stick with a solution that automated web browsers since that was all we needed and Watir was the best and most efficient choice for us.
